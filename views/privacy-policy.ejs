          <p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address
            and website

            when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
            <br />
            If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine
            if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you
            close your browser.
            <br />

            When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your
            screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a
            year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your

            If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This

          <h5>Embedded content from other websites
          </h5>
          <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.).
            Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited
            the other website.
            <Br />
            These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking,
            and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction
            with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>

            How long we retain your data?</h4>
          <p class="mb-4"> If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely.
            This is so we can
            recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a
            moderation queue.
            <br />
            For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they
            provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at
            any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and
            edit that information.

            receive an
            exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to
            us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not
